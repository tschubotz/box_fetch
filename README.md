Box Fetch
========

This is a prototype produced at the Deutsche Telekom Developer Garden/ Box Hackathon

BoxFetch is a light-weight interface to query the data distributed in both your Box account as well as the accounts of your collaborators.

Looking for that one file that your colleague stored three subdirectories down in his Box account but by accident did not share with you? - BoxFetch allows you to search across your colleagues' Box accounts from one simple interface.
